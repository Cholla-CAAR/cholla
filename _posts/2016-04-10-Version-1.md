summary:    A brief description of features included in Cholla 1.0 
---

Cholla is a 3D hydrodynamics code designed to quickly compute problems
on very large grids. Features included in the public release of Cholla, version 1.0
include:

* 1, 2, and 3D hydrodynamics
* Exact and Roe Riemann solvers (with HLL fallback)
* Piecewise constant, linear, and parabolic interface reconstruction
* Traditional, CTU, and Van Leer (predictor-corrector) integrators
* Dual energy formalism
* H correction to fix carbuncle instabilities
* Optically thin radiative cooling

Cholla includes a variety of test problems used to confirm the performance
and accuracy of the code.
