CHOLLA
============
A 3D GPU-based hydrodynamics code

Getting started
----------------
This is the stable branch of the Cholla code. Cholla is designed to 
be run using NVIDIA GPUs, and can be run in serial mode using one GPU
or with MPI.

Two example makefiles are included in this directory, one designed for
a linux machine, and one for a mac. After downloading the code, you should
be able to configure it by modifying one of these makefiles appropriately.
